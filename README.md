<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <strong>FOS - Drag and Drop</strong> dynamic action plug-in makes it possible to drag & drop elements inside a region. This could be a Cards region, a Badge list or basically everything that has a group of elements.</p>
<p>On every change of the order of items an event is fired passing the necessary change information accessible via "this.data" within your dynamic action handler. Additionally you can execute PL/SQL code to do an update of your database tables or execute some additional Javascript code.</p>
<p>The plug-in is built around Shopify's Draggable library (https://github.com/Shopify/draggable).</p>
