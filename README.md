<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <strong>FOS - Text Snippet Expand</strong> dynamic action plug-in extends one or multiple input fields to listen for entered shortcuts (e.g. "lol") and immediately expands them to a long version (e.g. "laughing out loud"). This is similar to an auto-correct functionality.
</p>
<p>This plug-in works on Text Fields, Text Areas, and CKEditor4 fields (APEX native and the "FOS - CKEditor4 plug-in"), as well as in  Interactive Grids.
</p>
<p>Shortcuts and their expanded text are provided as a query. Additionally you can also define stop-characters for a shortcut, that's the key after which a shortcut is evaluated. Default is space, period, comma, question mark, exclamation mark.
